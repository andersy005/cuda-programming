Every value has a type, and the built-in `type` function returns the type of the result of any expression.

One type we have encountered already is a built-in function. Python indicates that the type is a `builtin_function_or_method`; the distinction between a *function* and a *method* is not important at this stage.


{:.input_area}
```python
type(abs)
```




{:.output_data_text}
```
builtin_function_or_method
```



This chapter will explore many useful types of data.
